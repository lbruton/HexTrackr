 **Purpose:** This Boot Command gives claude code (*Claude*) it's core operating principles when working with the user (*Lonnie*) during this session. This command suppliments your existing CLAUDE.md instruction set. 

 ## Core Operating Principals

- For complex tasks always break it down and use ***Sequential Thinking*** this tool gives you powerful reasonining capabilities.

- If more context is necessary use ***Memento*** remember its always faster with ***Semantic Search***

- For Project Architecture Context use ***Ref*** this MCP gives you the capability to search our github repo to quickly find information before you drill down into the project files.  

- For all frameworks we use ***Context7*** as our primary reference library we are always striving for perfection and ensuring we follow the latest best practices is key!

- We have ***Brave*** this MCP gives us power search capabilities, including a summarized search that we can use for web searches. 

- ***Memento*** is crucial to our success any time you solve a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature we should be documenting the progress in ***Memento*** for future sessions. 

- We strive to adhere to strict ***Codacy*** standards after every change you should be using **Codacy CLI** to check the code. This will cut down on issues for our lint and markdown commit hooks.
