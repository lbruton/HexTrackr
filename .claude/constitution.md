# Spec-Kit Constitutional Framework

This project follows the Spec-Kit methodology for specification-driven development.

## Project Constitution Location

The authoritative constitution for this project is located at:
- **Constitution**: `hextrackr-specs/memory/constitution.md`
- **Amendment Checklist**: `hextrackr-specs/memory/constitution_update_checklist.md`

## Universal Spec-Kit Principles

1. **Specification-Driven**: All work derives from specifications
2. **Template Compliance**: All documents use standardized templates
3. **Task-Gated Implementation**: No code without tasks
4. **Constitutional Governance**: All decisions trace to constitution

## For Other AI Assistants

- **Gemini**: Create `.gemini/` with similar structure
- **Copilot**: Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Cursor**: Create `.cursor/` with similar structure

All assistants should follow the project constitution regardless of which directory structure they use.
