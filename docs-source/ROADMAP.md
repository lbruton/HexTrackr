## 📦 **VERSION PLANNING**

### Version 1.0.3 (Next Patch Release) 🚀

**Release Blockers**:

- [ ] **Security fixes from Codacy scan** (4 critical security issues)
- [ ] **Code quality compliance** (<50 total Codacy issues)
- [ ] **Comprehensive testing** of all security fixes

**Release Goals**:

- Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities
- Codacy compliance established as ongoing quality gate
- All security-related operations properly secured

### Version 1.1.0 (Next Minor Release)

**Features**:

- Chart Timeline Enhancement completion
- Performance optimization for large CSV files
- KEV Integration implementation
- Critical UI/UX fixes (CVE links, modal system)

**Quality Gates**:

- [ ] Maintain Codacy compliance (ongoing)

- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES TRACKING**

### Security & Compliance Issues

- **Codacy Security Vulnerabilities**: 4 critical issues blocking v1.0.3 release
- **Authentication Gap**: No authentication protects API endpoints or data access
- **File System Security**: Dynamic file paths in fs operations pose security risks
- **DOM Security**: innerHTML assignments create XSS vulnerability potential

### User Experience Issues

- **CVE Link Functionality**: CVE links open ALL CVEs instead of individual ones
- **Modal System**: Nested modals appear behind parent modals (z-index problems)
- **Layout Responsiveness**: Full-width layout with excessive dead space on desktop
- **AG Grid Issues**: Table cells don't auto-adjust on browser resize

### Data Management Issues

- **CSV Export Headers**: Export headers contain extra characters/corruption
- **Large File Performance**: 50-100MB CSV files cause memory issues
- **API Rate Limiting**: No protection against abuse or brute force attacks

## � **PROJECT METRICS & ACHIEVEMENTS**

### Technical Achievements

- ✅ **Database Optimization**: 97% storage reduction (193K → 6K records)
- ✅ **Production Data Recovery**: 100% recovery rate from corruption (16/16 tickets)
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Reduced Codacy issues from 370+ → 83 (-77% improvement)
- ✅ **API Completeness**: All CRUD endpoints implemented and tested
- ✅ **Zero-dependency Import/Export**: 100% web-based operation

### User Experience Achievements

- ✅ **Chart Performance**: 14-day default view with proper historical data
- ✅ **Data Management UX**: Complete import/export/backup/restore through web interface
- ✅ **Settings Modal**: Clean, organized interface with logical button groupings
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Zero technical knowledge required for data operations
- ✅ **Browser Testing**: Comprehensive Playwright automation validates functionality

### Current State

- **Version**: 1.0.2
- **Total Records**: 100,570 (17 tickets + 100,553 vulnerabilities)
- **Database Status**: Optimized time-series schema operational
- **Testing Coverage**: Browser automation with Playwright
- **Documentation**: Complete markdown-first portal system
