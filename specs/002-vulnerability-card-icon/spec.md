# Feature Specification: Vulnerability Card Icon and Font Color Fix

**Feature Branch**: `002-vulnerability-card-icon`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Vulnerability Card Icon and Font Color Fix - When I use my Vulnerability Management Dashboard I notice the four cards at the top of the page are using a different color scheme than the VPR Trends Table. Critical = Red, High = Orange, Medium = Blue, Low = Green. The page uses dark/light mode and the colors should be uniform in both views, and they should align with the choices made for the Vulnerability VPR Score Trends Over Time chart."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors (users), actions (viewing dashboard), data (vulnerability severities), constraints (color consistency)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a network administrator using the Vulnerability Management Dashboard, I need consistent color coding across all vulnerability severity indicators so that I can quickly identify and prioritize security risks without cognitive dissonance from mismatched visual cues.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing the dashboard in light mode, **When** I look at the stat cards and VPR trends chart, **Then** I see consistent colors: Critical (Red), High (Orange), Medium (Blue), Low (Green)

2. **Given** I am viewing the dashboard in dark mode, **When** I look at the stat cards and VPR trends chart, **Then** I see the same consistent color scheme with appropriate adjustments for dark background visibility

3. **Given** I am analyzing vulnerability trends, **When** I compare the stat card colors with the chart legend, **Then** the colors match exactly for each severity level

4. **Given** I have color vision deficiency, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I can still distinguish between severity levels through sufficient color contrast and supporting visual indicators

### Edge Cases

- What happens when switching between light and dark modes? Colors must update immediately and maintain consistency
- How does system handle high contrast mode or accessibility settings? Colors must remain distinguishable and meet WCAG AA standards
- What if user has custom browser color filters? Base colors should still maintain relative distinction between severities

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display Critical vulnerabilities in Red color across all dashboard components
- **FR-002**: System MUST display High vulnerabilities in Orange color across all dashboard components
- **FR-003**: System MUST display Medium vulnerabilities in Blue color across all dashboard components
- **FR-004**: System MUST display Low vulnerabilities in Green color across all dashboard components
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain color consistency between stat cards, icons, and chart visualizations
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all severity colors are visible and distinguishable in both light and dark themes
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply the same color scheme to trend indicators and percentage badges
- **FR-008**: System MUST meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **FR-009**: Icons within stat cards MUST use the same color as their severity level
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure color changes are applied consistently when theme is switched

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Vulnerability Severity Levels**: Four distinct categories (Critical, High, Medium, Low) that classify security risks
- **Color Mapping**: Consistent association between severity levels and specific colors
- **Theme Context**: Light and dark mode variations that affect color presentation
