# Feature Specification: Vulnerability VPR Score Trends Over Time Normalization

**Feature Branch**: `003-vulnerability-vpr-score`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Vulnerability VPR Score Trends Over Time Normalization

Problem: the current chart shows all 4 criticalities but the citicalities differ largely in value for example there are 148 critical, 1507 low, but 18,846 high, and 33706 medium. this makes the chart pretty difficult to see the changes between each value as the critical and low are flat lines at the bottom. I believe the term you told me would fix this is normalization? I could be wrong"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a network administrator analyzing vulnerability trends over time, I need to clearly see the trend patterns for all severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) on the VPR Score Trends chart, even when the absolute values differ by orders of magnitude, so that I can identify important changes and patterns in each severity category without smaller values being visually lost as flat lines.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a VPR trends chart with vastly different value ranges (e.g., 148 Critical vs 33,706 Medium), **When** the user views the chart, **Then** all four severity lines should be clearly visible and distinguishable with their trend patterns apparent
2. **Given** the normalized view is active, **When** the user hovers over any data point, **Then** the tooltip displays both the normalized percentage value and the actual raw count
3. **Given** the chart is displaying normalized data, **When** the user wants to see actual values, **Then** they can toggle between normalized and absolute value views
4. **Given** historical data with varying scales, **When** viewing trends over time, **Then** percentage changes and patterns are clearly visible for all severity levels regardless of their absolute values

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a severity level has zero vulnerabilities for a time period?
- How does the system handle when one severity level increases while others decrease?
- What display method is used when all values are similar in scale?
- How are percentage calculations handled when baseline values are very small (e.g., 1-2 vulnerabilities)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a normalized view option that scales all severity levels to be visually comparable on the same chart
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve access to actual vulnerability counts while displaying normalized data
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to toggle between normalized (percentage/indexed) and absolute value views
- **FR-004**: System MUST clearly label when data is normalized vs absolute values
- **FR-005**: Normalized view MUST show relative changes over time for each severity level
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle edge cases where values are zero or near-zero without breaking the visualization
- **FR-007**: Chart legend MUST indicate the current viewing mode (normalized vs absolute)
- **FR-008**: Tooltips MUST display both normalized and actual values when in normalized view
- **FR-009**: System MUST use percentage-based normalization (index to 100) as the primary normalization method, with optional logarithmic scale view for advanced users
- **FR-010**: System MUST use the first data point in the selected time range as the baseline for normalization (index = 100)
- **FR-011**: Default view MUST be normalized (indexed) view to immediately show trends, with easy toggle to absolute values

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Vulnerability Trend Data**: Time-series data containing counts for each severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) at specific time intervals
- **Normalization Settings**: User preferences for how data should be normalized (method, baseline, default view)
- **Chart View State**: Current display mode (normalized/absolute) and any user-selected options
