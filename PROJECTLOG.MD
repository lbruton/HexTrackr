# HexTrackr Project Log: A Reconstruction from Memento

This log is an automated reconstruction of the last 14 days of development activity, generated by Gemini by querying the Memento knowledge base.

## September 15, 2025

*   **Unified MCP Configuration:** A major milestone was achieved by synchronizing the MCP server configurations across all three primary AI interfaces: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Gemini. All systems now point to a single, shared Memento database (`/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@iachilles/memento/src/memory.db`), solving the critical problem of memory isolation and enabling unified knowledge sharing.

## September 14, 2025

*   **S-R-P-T Methodology Transformation:** The development workflow was officially transformed from a P-R-T (Plan-Research-Task) model to the more robust S-R-P-T (Specification-Research-Planning-Task) methodology. This included the creation of new boot commands (`/specify`, `/research`, `/plan`, `/tasks`) to automate and guide the process.
*   **Major Refactoring & Cleanup:** A significant cleanup effort took place. The documentation was modularized, and critical duplicate root files (`server.js`, `package.json`) that were causing versioning and runtime conflicts were removed.
*   **Critical Bug Fix & Process Improvement:** A severe bug that broke the application in light mode was resolved. The root cause was identified as CSS variables being scoped only to dark mode. This led to the creation of a new process: filing an After-Action Report (AAR) using the "Five Whys" method, which in turn led to enhancing the S-R-P-T templates to prevent similar scoping bugs in the future.
*   **Mermaid.js Integration:** The documentation portal was enhanced with client-side rendering for Mermaid.js diagrams, complete with theme-aware styling for light and dark modes.
*   **Security Planning:** Brainstorming and planning for a critical security patch (`v1.0.14`) began, focusing on adding a comprehensive authentication system.

## September 13, 2025

*   **Athena 2.0 Overhaul:** The Athena knowledge extraction system underwent a revolutionary upgrade. It can now process and index not just chat logs, but also the complete history of `todo` snapshots and shell commands from all 11 Claude projects. This creates a three-tier memory system (Memento entities, Markdown archives, and Vector embeddings) and provides a near-complete disaster recovery capability for the project's intellectual history.
*   **MCP Configuration & Migration:** The development environment's MCP server configuration was overhauled. The team migrated from the Kagi search API to the more cost-effective and feature-rich Brave Search Pro AI. All API key configurations were fixed and centralized.
*   **Claude's Persona Solidified:** The lead Claude assistant's personality was officially defined as Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith from The A-Team, emphasizing its role as a master strategist who directs the other specialized AI agents.

## September 12, 2025

*   **Spec 005 (Dark Mode) Planning Complete:** The comprehensive planning for the dark mode theme system was finalized. This involved creating the formal specification, a technical plan, data models, API contracts, and a testing guide. The "Three Stooges" agent pattern was used for parallel research into frontend security, backend architecture, and edge cases.
*   **AG-Grid v33 Upgrade & Theme Fix:** A major upgrade of the AG-Grid library to v33 was completed, including a migration to the new "Quartz" theme. This resolved numerous theme inconsistencies and visual bugs.
*   **Athena Semantic Search:** The Athena agent was enhanced with a dual-memory system, adding semantic search capabilities via vector embeddings (`mxbai-embed-large` model) to complement its existing keyword-based knowledge. This allows for more conceptual and relevant searching of the project's entire conversation history.
*   **Critical Fixes & Documentation Restoration:** A series of critical fixes were implemented, including resolving chart rendering bugs (missing lines, white backgrounds in dark mode), and a massive documentation "truth restoration" effort was completed to fix over 141 identified inaccuracies, bringing the docs back in line with the actual codebase.
*   **Version Management Automation:** The project's version manager tool was enhanced to be the single source of truth, synchronizing the version number across 6 key files, including `package.json`, `roadmap.json`, and `CLAUDE.md`.

## September 11, 2025

*   **MCP Server Expansion:** The development environment was enhanced by adding two new MCP servers: `Context7` for searching indexed library and framework documentation, and `Kagi` for advanced web search.
*   **Code Archaeology:** The "Dr. Jackson" agent performed a code archaeology session, confirming the codebase is modern and well-maintained, with no legacy `var` declarations or jQuery usage, and consistent formatting. The only significant finding was TODOs related to future Cisco/Tenable API integration.
*   **Roadmap & Documentation Fixes:** Atlas, the roadmap agent, had its filtering logic corrected to ensure the "Active Specifications" table in the documentation portal accurately shows only pending tasks, not completed ones.

## September 10, 2025

*   **Major Architectural Shift (CVE Handling):** A critical architectural decision was made to change how vulnerabilities with multiple CVEs are handled. Instead of parsing them at display time (which caused numerous bugs), the import process now splits them into individual database records. This simplifies the frontend, fixes a critical bug where clicking one CVE link would open multiple tabs, and improves data integrity.
*   **Critical Bug Triage & Testing:** A comprehensive security audit was performed, and several critical bugs related to the CVE modal were identified and documented through a new, robust E2E testing suite. This included a race condition that prevented modals from opening and a missing CVE column in the device security view.
*   **Spec-Kit Workflow Validation:** A deep validation of the spec-kit workflow revealed that specifications lacked the business context needed for AI agents to generate complete, actionable plans. This led to the key insight that specs must be detailed enough to not require guesswork from the planning agents.

## September 09, 2025

*   **Spec-Aware Workflow:** A new spec-aware workflow was implemented, supported by updates to several shell scripts (`common.sh`, `setup-plan.sh`, `create-new-spec.sh`). This new workflow was instrumental in the completion of Spec 022.
*   **Roadmap Synchronization:** A discrepancy between the project roadmap and the 23 active specifications was identified and resolved. The `sync-specs-to-roadmap.js` script and the documentation generation pipeline were reviewed and updated to ensure proper integration.
*   **Spec-Kit Compliance:** All project spec files were reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Spec-Kit framework. Plans and tasks were regenerated for each spec file.

## September 08, 2025

*   **Workflow & Documentation:** A "Phase 0 project structure" section was added to the roadmap, and the documentation pipeline was verified. Research was conducted into GitHub's "spec-kit" framework, which led to the integration of a new spec-kit workflow and the automation of task creation from specifications. Existing project documentation was reconciled with the new system to avoid duplication of work.

## September 07, 2025

*   **WebSocket Implementation:** The team finalized a 3-phase implementation strategy for WebSocket functionality using Socket.io. Memento and Git were used for knowledge management and version control.

## September 06, 2025

*   **Multi-Agent Analysis:** A multi-agent Opus-based analysis of the project documentation was performed. The findings were used to update the project roadmap and API documentation, ensuring all project artifacts were synchronized with the latest architectural decisions.

## September 05, 2025

*   **Documentation & Architecture:** A major documentation update was performed to reflect new architectural priorities. Key documents like the `ROADMAP.md`, `SPRINT.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` were updated to prioritize the ongoing JavaScript modularization effort.

## September 04, 2025

*   **Task Management:** A single `todo` item was updated, indicating ongoing task management. No other significant activity was recorded on this day.

## August 14, 2025

*   **Foundation Work:** The earliest recoverable logs show foundational work on the project's tooling. A shell function named `gemedit` was developed, likely to streamline file editing and manipulation during development. This period was characterized by iterative tool development and task management.

*   **WebSocket Implementation:** The team finalized a 3-phase implementation strategy for WebSocket functionality using Socket.io. Memento and Git were used for knowledge management and version control.

## September 06 - August 14, 2025

*   **Historical Note:** The Memento reconstruction exercise, using the `athena-semantic-search.js` tool, has successfully recovered and logged the key development activities from August 14th, 2025, to September 7th, 2025. While the raw conversation logs for this period are not as detailed as the later entries, the semantic search capabilities of Athena 2.0 have allowed for a comprehensive reconstruction of the project's history.
