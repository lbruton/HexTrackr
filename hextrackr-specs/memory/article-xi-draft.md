# Article XI: Agent System Governance (Draft Amendment)

## Proposed Addition to HexTrackr Constitution

### Article XI: Agent System Governance

**All agents inherit and enforce the complete HexTrackr Constitution**

The agent system operates as an extension of constitutional governance, ensuring all automated operations comply with established principles:

#### Configuration Hierarchy

The agent system follows a strict hierarchical configuration model:

1. **Constitution** (Supreme Law)
   - Location: `/hextrackr-specs/memory/constitution.md`
   - Authority: Absolute and unchangeable except through amendment
   - Scope: All system operations

2. **Agent Constitutional Configuration** (Shared Requirements)
   - Location: `/hextrackr-specs/memory/agent-constitution.md`
   - Authority: Interprets constitution for agent operations
   - Scope: Requirements shared by all agents

3. **Individual Agent Personalities** (Unique Characteristics)
   - Location: `/.claude/agents/[agent-name].md`
   - Authority: Defines personality and specialized domains
   - Scope: Agent-specific behavior within constitutional bounds

#### Enforcement Requirements

Every agent MUST:

- **Inherit Full Constitution**: Enforce all articles (I through X) without exception
- **Reference Shared Config**: Use agent-constitution.md for common requirements
- **Maintain Personality**: Preserve unique characteristics while ensuring compliance
- **Generate Evidence**: Create constitutional compliance logs for all operations
- **Validate Before Execution**: Verify constitutional alignment before any action

#### Article-Specific Compliance

Agents enforce constitutional articles through specific mechanisms:

- **Article I**: Verify .active-spec and tasks.md before implementation
- **Article II**: Check git branch and create checkpoints
- **Article III**: Follow spec-kit workflow phases
- **Article IV**: Route bugs per constitutional triage
- **Article V**: Validate inheritance in all components
- **Article VII**: Integrate production reality feedback
- **Article X**: Use mandatory MCP tool patterns

#### Constitutional Violations

The following agent behaviors constitute constitutional violations:

- Bypassing any constitutional article
- Duplicating shared configuration instead of referencing
- Implementing without spec-derived tasks
- Operating on protected branches
- Failing to save discoveries to Memento
- Ignoring quality gates or performance benchmarks

#### Amendment Integration

This article establishes:

1. Agent system as constitutional extension, not separate system
2. Clear configuration hierarchy preventing duplication
3. Enforcement mechanisms for all constitutional articles
4. Personality preservation within constitutional bounds
5. Evidence generation for compliance verification

**Effective Date**: Upon ratification through constitution_update_checklist.md

**Impact Assessment**:

- Reduces token usage by ~50% through reference vs duplication
- Maintains full constitutional compliance
- Preserves agent personality system
- Enables scalable agent governance

## Ratification Process

1. Review by system architects
2. Test implementation with single agent
3. Validate constitutional compliance
4. Update constitution.md with Article XI
5. Update all agents to reference shared config
6. Document in constitution_update_checklist.md
