Task: "Update modal data population to filter by clicked CVE ID"
Task: "Create Jest unit tests for CVE event handler isolation"
```

## Bug Fixes

- [ ] B001: **CRITICAL** - CVE links open all CVE details instead of specific CVE
  - **Severity**: Critical (Production Bug)
  - **Impact**: Users cannot view individual CVE details, all CVEs display together
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript event delegation not properly isolating clicked CVE ID
  - **Files**: vulnerability-grid.js, vulnerability-cards.js, vulnerability-details-modal.js
  - **Fix Estimate**: 4-6 hours for comprehensive fix across all views
  - **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests + manual validation across browsers

- [ ] B004: **CRITICAL** - Multiple CVEs in import CSV only stores first CVE, losing additional CVEs
  - **Severity**: Critical (Active Data Loss Bug - elevated per Shemp analysis)
  - **Impact**: When importing CSV with multiple CVEs ("CVE-2024-1234, CVE-2024-5678"), only CVE-2024-1234 is stored
  - **Root Cause**: server.js line 261-263 `cve.split(",")[0].trim()` discards all CVEs except first
  - **Stooges Consensus**: Option A Plus - preserve full CVE string instead of truncating
  - **Shemp Enhancement**: Immediate fix + security review + data migration strategy
  - **Solution**: Remove truncation logic, store complete CVE field as-is
  - **Files**: app/public/server.js mapVulnerabilityRow() function
  - **Fix Estimate**: 30 minutes (remove 3 lines + testing with multi-CVE CSV)
  - **Testing**: Import test-data/multi-cve-test.csv and verify complete CVE strings stored
  - **Test File**: Created test-data/multi-cve-test.csv with comma/space-separated CVE examples
  - **Priority**: IMMEDIATE - prevents ongoing data loss in production

- [ ] B002: Modal state not properly cleared between CVE selections
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Impact**: Previous CVE data may persist when opening different CVE details
  - **Root Cause**: Insufficient modal state cleanup in vulnerability-details-modal.js
  - **Shemp Enhancement**: Add race condition protection and memory leak prevention
  - **Fix Estimate**: 2-3 hours
  - **Testing**: Modal state unit tests + E2E validation

- [ ] B003: Inconsistent CVE link behavior across different views
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Impact**: CVE links behave differently in table vs cards vs search
  - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent event handling patterns across modules
  - **Shemp Enhancement**: Shared utilities foundation (T038) addresses this systematically
  - **Fix Estimate**: 2-4 hours for standardization
  - **Testing**: Cross-view consistency testing
