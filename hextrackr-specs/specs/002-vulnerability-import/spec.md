# Feature Specification: Vulnerability Import System

**Feature Branch**: `002-vulnerability-import`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "CSV vulnerability import with intelligent deduplication and rollover analysis"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a network administrator, I want to upload vulnerability scan CSV files and have the system automatically identify new, persistent, and resolved vulnerabilities so that I can focus on the most critical security issues without manually comparing scan results.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a CSV file from vulnerability scanner, **When** I upload the file, **Then** system processes and displays import summary with new/persistent/resolved counts
2. **Given** duplicate vulnerability entries exist, **When** system processes import, **Then** duplicates are automatically identified and merged based on hostname+CVE
3. **Given** vulnerabilities from previous scan no longer appear, **When** system processes new scan, **Then** missing vulnerabilities are marked as resolved with timestamps

### Edge Cases

- What happens when CSV file is malformed or has missing required columns?
- How does system handle very large files (50MB+) without timeout?
- What occurs when the same vulnerability appears with different severity levels between scans?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept CSV file uploads up to 100MB in size
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse CSV files from multiple vulnerability scanner formats (Tenable, Qualys, OpenVAS)
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform intelligent deduplication using hostname+CVE as primary key
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically classify vulnerabilities as NEW, PERSISTENT, RESOLVED, or UPDATED
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide rollover analysis comparing current import to previous scan data
- **FR-006**: System MUST normalize hostname formats to prevent false duplicates
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate CVE identifiers and severity levels during import
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain complete audit trail of all import activities
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide progress feedback during large file processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle malformed data gracefully with clear error messages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Vulnerability Record**: Individual vulnerability entry containing hostname, CVE identifier, severity level, description, and scanner metadata
- **Import Session**: Complete CSV processing session with file metadata, processing timestamps, and result summary statistics
- **Rollover Analysis**: Comparison results between current and previous vulnerability scan data, tracking status changes over time
