# Curly's Creative Research Adventure - Ticket Bridging Data Model

**Task**: Generate comprehensive data-model.md for spec 003-ticket-bridging using constitutional patterns

**Creative Discoveries**:
- Hub-and-spoke coordination pattern fits perfectly with HexTrackr's existing architecture!
- Export-based integration is GENIUS - avoids complex API maintenance while maintaining flexibility
- Three-tier team hierarchy (Team → Supervisor → Individual) creates perfect organizational structure
- ZIP package exports with markdown templates = universal compatibility! Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!

**Architecture Insights**:
- Research shows hierarchical team assignment model with escalation workflows
- Export system uses standardized markdown templates + ZIP packages for portability  
- Multi-platform templates (Jira, ServiceNow, GitHub) with configurable field mapping
- Security boundaries with team isolation and supervisor visibility
- Performance targets: <30sec ZIP export, <1sec dashboard loading, 50+ concurrent users

**Constitutional Pattern Analysis**:
- Studied completed spec 002 data-model.md structure for constitutional compliance
- Required sections: Entity Definitions, Database Schema, Validation Rules, Performance Constraints, Integration Mappings
- TypeScript branded types for security-sensitive data (CVEId, HostnameId, etc.)
- SQLite WAL optimization with comprehensive indexing strategies
- Repository pattern integration with service layer abstractions

**Fun Facts**:
- Ticket bridging solves the "lost ticket" problem with mandatory handoff acknowledgment
- ZIP packages include metadata.json for API imports AND markdown for human readability
- Attachment security with virus scanning and AES-256 encryption - soitenly secure!
- Template versioning prevents import failures with automated validation

**Implementation Readiness**:
- HexTrackr foundations perfect: WebSocket progress tracking, PathValidator security, Express.js patterns
- Database schema extensions cleanly integrate with existing ticket system
- Template engine (Handlebars.js) + archiver library for ZIP generation
- Team management extends existing user system with roles and assignments

**Next Steps**: Generate the complete data-model.md with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces, SQLite schema optimization, and performance constraints

**Energy Level**: HIGH - This ticket coordination system is gonna be fantastic! Woo-woo-woo-woo!
