# S000: [Feature Name] Template

*Specification Phase: WHAT and WHY*

> **Status**: [DRAFT/IN_PROGRESS/NEEDS_CLARIFICATION/READY] | **Research**: R00X | **Planning**: P00X | **Tasks**: T00X
> **Workflow**: S-R-P-T (Specification → Research → Planning → Tasks)

## Problem Statement

[Clear description of the problem being solved. What specific issue or opportunity are we addressing?]

## Current State Check

*Brief review of how things work now - helps researchers understand the foundation*

- **Current implementation**: [How does this area currently work, if applicable?]
- **Key files/systems involved**: [What code, components, or systems are affected?]
- **Known quirks or constraints**: [Any architectural patterns, limitations, or gotchas?]

## Current Issues

- **Issue 1**: [Describe specific problem]
- **Issue 2**: [Describe specific problem]
- **Issue 3**: [Describe specific problem]

## Goals

### Primary Objective

[Main goal of this feature - what success looks like]

### Success Criteria

- ✅ [Measurable criterion 1]
- ✅ [Measurable criterion 2]
- ✅ [Measurable criterion 3]

## Strategic Approach

### High-Level Strategy

[Overall approach to solving the problem - the big picture solution]

### Key Principles

1. **Principle 1**: [Guiding principle for implementation]
2. **Principle 2**: [Guiding principle for implementation]
3. **Principle 3**: [Guiding principle for implementation]

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- [Technical limitation 1]
- [Technical limitation 2]
- [Technical limitation 3]

### Business Constraints

- [Business limitation 1]
- [Business limitation 2]
- [Business limitation 3]

## Success Metrics

- **Metric 1**: [How will we measure success - specific numbers/percentages]
- **Metric 2**: [How will we measure success - specific numbers/percentages]
- **Metric 3**: [How will we measure success - specific numbers/percentages]

## Open Questions & Clarifications Needed

*Mark items as [CLARIFIED] once resolved through dialogue*

- [ ] **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: [Question or unclear requirement]
- [ ] **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: [Technical constraint or assumption to verify]
- [ ] **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: [Success criteria definition needed]

## Assumptions & Dependencies

*Document assumptions made during specification - to be validated in Research phase*

- **Assumption 1**: [Technical/business assumption - needs validation in R00X]
- **Assumption 2**: [Framework/tool assumption - needs research]
- **Dependency 1**: [External dependency or prerequisite]

## Context for Research Phase

*Key technical details researchers need to know before starting analysis*

- **Architecture patterns**: [What patterns, frameworks, or conventions are in use?]
- **Testing requirements**: [How should solutions be validated? Docker? Both themes?]
- **Critical constraints**: [What must researchers keep in mind during analysis?]

## Next Steps

→ **Research Phase (R00X)**: Multi-agent technical analysis using expert agents to validate assumptions, resolve clarifications, and determine implementation approach. Research will use parallel analysis patterns with specialized agents for comprehensive investigation.

---

*This is a specification document focusing on WHAT we want to achieve and WHY it's important. All technical details, HOW to implement, and assumption validation will be covered in R00X research phase.*
