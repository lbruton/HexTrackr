# T000: [Feature Name] - Implementation Tasks

*Task Phase: DO the implementation*

## Success Criteria Validation

*Before starting implementation, confirm alignment with original requirements*

### S001 Success Criteria Check

- [ ] **Requirement 1**: [Specific success criteria from S001] - Implementation approach confirmed
- [ ] **Requirement 2**: [Specific success criteria from S001] - Implementation approach confirmed
- [ ] **Requirement 3**: [Specific success criteria from S001] - Implementation approach confirmed

### Implementation Validation Points

- [ ] **Environment Testing**: All target environments (themes, browsers, devices) identified
- [ ] **Edge Case Coverage**: Known edge cases from R001 research accounted for
- [ ] **Assumption Verification**: All P001 assumptions validated before proceeding
- [ ] **Regression Prevention**: Areas of potential impact identified and protected
