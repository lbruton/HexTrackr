    <h1>Security Overview</h1>
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->
<p>HexTrackr is designed with security in mind. This document provides an overview of the security measures in place. For a detailed breakdown of the security implementation, see the <a href="#security/security-implementation">Security Implementation</a> documentation.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database</strong>: The SQLite database is stored locally on the server. Access is restricted to the backend application.</li>
<li><strong>File Uploads</strong>: Uploaded CSV files are stored temporarily and processed securely. They are deleted after processing.</li>
<li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: All user input is validated on the backend to prevent common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secure Development</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: We use <code>npm audit</code> to regularly check for vulnerabilities in our dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: The application is containerized using Docker, which provides process isolation and a controlled environment.</li>
<li><strong>Code Analysis</strong>: We use static analysis tools like ESLint and Codacy to identify potential security issues in the codebase.</li>
</ul>
