### [v1.1.12](#changelog/versions/1.1.12) - 2025-11-04
**Category**: Update

Restored Material Design elevation principles to light mode with blue-gray surface hierarchy, fixed missing CSS files across tickets.html and documentation portal, and unified search bar presentation with card-based design.

### [v1.1.11](#changelog/versions/1.1.11) - 2025-10-31
**Category**: Bug Fix

### [v1.1.10](#changelog/versions/1.1.10) - 2025-10-28
**Category**: Bug Fix

Replaced simple substring extraction with intelligent hostname parsing for ticket creation. Location values now use HostnameParserService API (e.g., "BARNHA" instead of "BARNH"), and site codes are intelligently pre-filled from historical tickets database or left blank for user entry from Hexagon EAM.
