### [v1.1.4](#changelog/versions/1.1.4) - Unknown date

### [v1.1.3](#changelog/versions/1.1.3) - 2025-10-23
**Category**: Maintenance

HexTrackr v1.1.3 removes two unused dependencies (Chart.js and Stagehand) that were creating technical debt and dependency conflicts. This cleanup eliminates ~300KB of unused packages, resolves peer dependency issues with dotenv, and removes misleading documentation that incorrectly referenced Chart.js instead of the actually-used ApexCharts library.

### [v1.1.2](#changelog/versions/1.1.2) - 2025-10-23
**Category**: Bug Fix

HexTrackr v1.1.2 addresses five bugs: four ESLint-detected code quality issues (undefined variable usage in error logging, deprecated event handling patterns, variable scoping in try/catch/finally blocks, and incorrect function name) and one missing script dependency in the documentation portal that prevented backup modal buttons from working. These fixes improve error diagnostics, ensure modern JavaScript compatibility, restore full functionality to the documentation portal settings modal, and fix Cisco advisory statistics not refreshing after manual sync.

### [v1.1.1](#changelog/versions/1.1.1) - 2025-10-23
**Category**: Bug Fix

HexTrackr v1.1.1 addresses UX inconsistencies in the ticket creation workflow introduced in v1.0.57's power tools feature. This patch release ensures hostname normalization consistency across all ticket creation entry points and fixes critical sorting bugs in bulk ticket creation that prevented proper boot order planning.

### [v1.1.0](#changelog/versions/1.1.0) - 2025-10-22
**Category**: Enhancement

HexTrackr v1.1.0 establishes a new baseline for database schema initialization by consolidating fragmented table creation logic from three separate pathways (init script, service constructors, migrations) into a single, comprehensive initialization script. This architectural improvement provides a clear single source of truth for the complete 21-table schema, eliminates documentation drift, and simplifies developer onboarding.

### [v1.0.101](#changelog/versions/1.0.101) - 2025-10-22
**Category**: Bug Fix

Implemented deterministic window naming for CVE reference links, enabling users to compare multiple security advisories (CVE.org, NIST NVD, vendor advisories) side-by-side while preventing duplicate window proliferation. Each reference type opens in its own uniquely-named popup that can be reused when clicked again.

### [v1.0.100](#changelog/versions/1.0.100) - 2025-10-22
**Category**: UI/UX Enhancement

Comprehensive redesign of vulnerability cards and modal layout to improve information density, visual hierarchy, and user experience. Implemented KEV-based color coding, individual VPR badges, vendor-colored device counts, and optimized modal card alignment.

### [v1.0.99](#changelog/versions/1.0.99) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Feature

Added a References section to the Vulnerability Details Modal that displays curated CVE reference links from the CVE.org API. Uses a config-driven blacklist to filter out broken domains (securityfocus.com, securitytracker.com) while showing all working references. Default references (CVE.org Official Record + NIST NVD) are always displayed first.

### [v1.0.98](#changelog/versions/1.0.98) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Enhancement

Simplified vendor filtering by removing the vendor dropdown from the search area and making the radio buttons at the top of the page the single source of truth for all vendor filtering (workspace + charts). This eliminates user confusion from having two separate vendor filter controls.

### [v1.0.97](#changelog/versions/1.0.97) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Bug Fix

Decoupled the "All Vendors" dropdown from chart filtering. The dropdown now filters only the Vulnerability Data Workspace (devices, vulnerabilities, locations, table views) and does not affect charts. Charts remain controlled exclusively by their dedicated vendor filter radio buttons.
