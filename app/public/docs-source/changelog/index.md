## Recent Releases

### [v1.0.101](#changelog/versions/1.0.101) - 2025-10-22
**Category**: Bug Fix

Implemented deterministic window naming for CVE reference links, enabling users to compare multiple security advisories (CVE.org, NIST NVD, vendor advisories) side-by-side while preventing duplicate window proliferation. Each reference type opens in its own uniquely-named popup that can be reused when clicked again.

### [v1.0.100](#changelog/versions/1.0.100) - 2025-10-22
**Category**: UI/UX Enhancement

Comprehensive redesign of vulnerability cards and modal layout to improve information density, visual hierarchy, and user experience. Implemented KEV-based color coding, individual VPR badges, vendor-colored device counts, and optimized modal card alignment.

### [v1.0.99](#changelog/versions/1.0.99) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Feature

Added a References section to the Vulnerability Details Modal that displays curated CVE reference links from the CVE.org API. Uses a config-driven blacklist to filter out broken domains (securityfocus.com, securitytracker.com) while showing all working references. Default references (CVE.org Official Record + NIST NVD) are always displayed first.

### [v1.0.98](#changelog/versions/1.0.98) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Enhancement

Simplified vendor filtering by removing the vendor dropdown from the search area and making the radio buttons at the top of the page the single source of truth for all vendor filtering (workspace + charts). This eliminates user confusion from having two separate vendor filter controls.

### [v1.0.97](#changelog/versions/1.0.97) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Bug Fix

Decoupled the "All Vendors" dropdown from chart filtering. The dropdown now filters only the Vulnerability Data Workspace (devices, vulnerabilities, locations, table views) and does not affect charts. Charts remain controlled exclusively by their dedicated vendor filter radio buttons.

**Category**: Enhancement

Improved Vulnerability Data Workspace menu item ordering for better user workflow and logical navigation flow.

### [v1.0.95](#changelog/versions/1.0.95) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Feature

Implemented real-time countdown timers and health indicators for all three background API sync services (Cisco PSIRT, Palo Alto Security Advisory, CISA KEV) to provide visibility into sync scheduling and service health.

### [v1.0.94](#changelog/versions/1.0.94) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Enhancement

Normalized supervisor and tech fields from Hexagon EAM export format (`LAST,FIRST` all-caps) to proper case `First Last` format. Implemented write-time normalization pattern (store clean data) enabling future location→supervisor→contact lookup feature while eliminating 94 lines of duplicate normalization code across template files.

### [v1.0.93](#changelog/versions/1.0.93) - 2025-10-21
**Category**: Enhancement

Established a unified design system across all HexTrackr modals with consistent icon-first layouts, prominent severity-based borders, and centralized CSS variables. This release includes cache-busting cleanup, VPR Risk Breakdown card redesign in the Device Security Modal, and Risk Summary card redesign in the Vulnerability Details Modal.

### [v1.0.92](#changelog/versions/1.0.92) - 2025-10-19
**Category**: Enhancement

Improved the Location Details Modal's "Devices at Location" table with enhanced color coding for better visual risk communication and vendor identification. Replaced confusing KEV-based hostname coloring with vendor-based colors, and added KEV-based coloring to CVE and VPR columns for consistent risk visualization.
