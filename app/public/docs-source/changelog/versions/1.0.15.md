## [1.0.15] - 2025-09-17

### Changed (5)

#### Backend Modularization Complete

- **Monolithic Refactor Achievement**: Successfully modularized 3,805-line monolithic server.js
  - Reduced main server.js to ~205 lines (94.6% reduction)
  - Extracted into 5 controllers, 4 services, 5 routes, 3 config modules, and 3 utilities
  - Implemented singleton pattern for controllers with dependency injection
  - Maintained 100% backward compatibility with all existing APIs
- **Module Organization**:
  - `/app/controllers/` - Business logic with singleton pattern (5 controllers)
  - `/app/services/` - Data access layer (4 services)
  - `/app/routes/` - Express route definitions (5 route modules)
  - `/app/config/` - Configuration modules (database, middleware, websocket)
  - `/app/utils/` - Utility classes (PathValidator, ProgressTracker, helpers)
- **Critical Initialization Sequence**: Established proper dependency injection order
  - Database initialization → Controller initialization → Route imports → Server start
  - Fixed initialization timing issues that caused "Controller not initialized" errors

### Added (12)

- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Module dependency diagram with ASCII visualization
  - Migration rollback procedure for emergency recovery
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with modular patterns and initialization sequence
  - Comprehensive architecture documentation reflecting new structure

### Fixed (15)

- **Controller Reference Pattern**: Fixed class vs instance pattern in all route files
- **Route Mounting**: Corrected path concatenation issues (e.g., /api/imports/imports)
- **File Name Case Sensitivity**: Standardized on lowercase controller filenames

### Technical Debt Resolved

- **T053 Backend Modularization**: Completed full extraction from monolithic architecture
- **Maintainability**: Improved code organization from single 3,805-line file to 15+ focused modules
- **Testability**: Enabled unit testing through dependency injection and service separation
