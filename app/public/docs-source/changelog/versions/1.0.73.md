# Version 1.0.73 - Logging System Session 9: Migrate Remaining Backend Services

**Release Status**: 🚧 In Progress
**Release Date**: TBD
**Parent Issue**: [HEX-252](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEX-252)
**Implementation**: [HEX-254](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEX-254) Session 9

## Overview

Migrate remaining backend services to use the unified LoggingService. This includes vulnerability service, ticket service, backup service, and other supporting services that haven't been migrated yet.

## Implementation Tasks

### Planned
- [ ] Identify remaining backend services with console statements
- [ ] Migrate vulnerabilityService.js
- [ ] Migrate ticketService.js (if not done in Session 8)
- [ ] Migrate backupService.js
- [ ] Migrate cacheService.js
- [ ] Migrate other supporting services
- [ ] Add audit logging for critical operations
- [ ] Test all migrated services

### Completed
- [ ] TBD

## Technical Details

**Files to Migrate**: TBD (to be identified)

**Console Statements Found**: TBD

**Migration Pattern**:
```javascript
// Add defensive helpers at top of each service
function _log(level, message, data = {}) {
    if (global.logger && global.logger.[category] && typeof global.logger[category][level] === 'function') {
        global.logger.[category][level](message, data);
    }
}

function _audit(category, message, data = {}) {
    if (global.logger && typeof global.logger.audit === 'function') {
        global.logger.audit(category, message, data, null, null);
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria

- [X] Version bumped to v1.0.73 across 5 files
- [ ] All remaining backend services migrated to LoggingService
- [ ] Critical operations have audit logging
- [ ] No console statements remain in backend services
- [ ] All services tested and verified
