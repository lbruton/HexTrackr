## [1.0.49] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed

#### Dark Mode Card Background Colors and Rounded Corners (HEX-122)

**Issue**: Cards in dark mode had two problems:
1. Cards shared the same background color as the page background, eliminating visual hierarchy
2. Card headers and bodies appeared as square elements floating on top of rounded containers

**Root Cause**:
1. September 25th revert (commit `e01b7dd`) removed 33 lines of Bootstrap card dark mode styling
2. CSS load order issue - `cards.css` loads after `dark-theme.css`, and `.card-body` and `.card-header` lacked explicit `border-radius` values

**Resolution**:

**Dark Theme Colors** (`app/public/styles/shared/dark-theme.css`):
- Cards now use `#1e293b` (lighter slate) background, visibly distinct from page background `#1a2234` (darker)
- Card headers use `#1a2234` background matching page background for subtle hierarchy
- Card bodies have consistent `#1e293b` background with proper text color (`#e2e8f0`)
- Stats cards have enhanced hover effects with border color transitions

**Border Radius Fix** (`app/public/styles/shared/cards.css`):
- `.card-body` - Added `border-radius: 8px` to match parent `.card` (all corners rounded)
- `.card-header` - Added `border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0 !important` (top corners only, requires `!important` to override Tabler.io)

**Testing**: Verified in both light and dark modes via Chrome DevTools - cards now have proper visual hierarchy with lighter backgrounds and clean rounded corners throughout.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/public/styles/shared/dark-theme.css` - Lines 24-55 (Bootstrap Card Dark Mode Styling)
- `app/public/styles/shared/cards.css` - Line 29 (card-header border-radius), Line 45 (card-body border-radius)
