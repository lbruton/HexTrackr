# Version 1.0.71 - Logging System Session 7: Database Service Migration

**Release Status**: 🚧 In Progress
**Release Date**: TBD
**Parent Issue**: [HEX-252](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEX-252)
**Implementation**: [HEX-254](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEX-254) Session 7 | [HEX-259](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEX-259)

## Overview

Migrate database service to use the unified LoggingService for database operations, queries, transactions, and errors. This establishes logging patterns for data persistence layer.

## Implementation Tasks

### Planned
- [ ] Migrate 26 console statements to LoggingService
- [ ] Add logging for database initialization
- [ ] Add logging for transaction management
- [ ] Add logging for VACUUM operations with audit trail
- [ ] Add error logging for database failures
- [ ] Add performance logging for slow queries (>500ms)
- [ ] Test database operations with new logging

### Completed
- [ ] TBD

## Technical Details

**File Modified**: `app/services/databaseService.js`

**Console Statements Found**: 26 total
- 14× `console.error` - Database errors, VACUUM failures, query errors
- 2× `console.warn` - VACUUM status warnings
- 10× `console.log` - VACUUM operations, database connection status

**Migration Pattern**:
```javascript
// BEFORE
console.log("Connected to SQLite database");

// AFTER
global.logger.database.info("Database connection established", {
    path: this.dbPath,
    mode: "WAL"
});
```

## Success Criteria

- [X] Version bumped to v1.0.71 across 5 files
- [ ] All console statements replaced with category-based logging
- [ ] VACUUM operations logged with audit trail
- [ ] Slow queries (>500ms) logged with warnings
- [ ] No console.log statements remain in databaseService.js
- [ ] Database operations tested and verified
