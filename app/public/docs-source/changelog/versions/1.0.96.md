## Overview

Improved Vulnerability Data Workspace menu item ordering for better user workflow and logical navigation flow.

## Changes

### UX Improvements

**Workspace Menu Reordering**:
- Reordered menu buttons for more intuitive navigation flow
- **Previous Order**: Devices → Vulnerabilities → Locations → Table
- **New Order**: Devices → Locations → Vulnerabilities → Table

**Rationale**: Users typically navigate from devices to their locations before drilling into specific vulnerabilities. The new order matches this natural workflow progression.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/public/vulnerabilities.html:369-387` - Menu button reordering

## Technical Details

**Change Type**: Pure HTML reordering (no logic changes)
**Testing**: Visual verification of button order
