# Version 1.0.101 - CVE Reference Links Open in Multiple Popups

**Release Status**: Released
**Release Date**: 2025-10-22
**Category**: Bug Fix
**Issue**: [HEX-314](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEX-314)

## Overview

Fixed CVE reference links in the Vulnerability Details Modal to open in separate popup windows instead of reusing the same window. This enables users to compare multiple security advisories (CVE.org, NIST NVD, vendor advisories) side-by-side during vulnerability research.

## Fixed

### CVE Reference Links Reusing Same Popup Window (HEX-314)

**Problem**:
- Clicking any CVE reference link opened in a 1200x1200 popup window
- Clicking a second reference link replaced the first popup's content
- Users could not compare multiple advisories side-by-side
- Expected: Each link opens its own popup for parallel comparison

**Root Cause**:
- `window.open()` was using a named window target `'cve_ref_popup'`
- Per W3C/WHATWG specification, named targets reuse existing windows with that name
- All reference links shared the same target name, causing window reuse

**Solution**:
- Changed window target from `'cve_ref_popup'` to `'_blank'`
- `'_blank'` forces each link to open in a new browsing context
- Window features (`width=1200,height=1200`) maintain popup behavior

**File Modified**:
- `app/public/scripts/shared/vulnerability-details-modal.js:234` - One-word change

**Code Change**:
```diff
- onclick="window.open('${sanitizedUrl}', 'cve_ref_popup', 'width=1200,height=1200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false;"
+ onclick="window.open('${sanitizedUrl}', '_blank', 'width=1200,height=1200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false;"
```

## User Experience Improvements

**Before Fix**:
1. Click "CVE.org Official Record" → Opens popup
2. Click "NIST NVD" → Replaces first popup content (CVE.org closes)
3. Cannot compare multiple sources simultaneously

**After Fix**:
1. Click "CVE.org Official Record" → Opens first popup
2. Click "NIST NVD" → Opens second popup (first remains open)
3. Click vendor advisory → Opens third popup (both previous remain open)
4. All popups maintain 1200x1200 dimensions for optimal viewing
5. Users can compare multiple authoritative sources side-by-side

**Use Case**: Security researchers need to cross-reference CVE.org official records, NIST NVD analysis, and vendor-specific advisories simultaneously to understand vulnerability scope, affected versions, and remediation strategies.

## Technical Details

**window.open() Target Parameter Behavior**:
- **Named target** (e.g., `'cve_ref_popup'`): Reuses existing window with that name
- **`'_blank'`**: Always creates new browsing context
- **Window features**: `width=1200,height=1200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes` forces popup vs tab

**Browser Compatibility**: This is standard W3C behavior supported by all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Validation

- ✅ CVE.org Official Record opens in new popup
- ✅ NIST NVD opens in separate popup (first remains open)
- ✅ Vendor advisory links each open in new popups
- ✅ All popups maintain 1200x1200 dimensions
- ✅ Multiple popups can be arranged side-by-side
- ✅ No regression in popup functionality
- ✅ Dark/light theme compatibility verified
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
