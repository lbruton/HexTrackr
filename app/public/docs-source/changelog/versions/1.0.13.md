### Fixed (17)

#### Card Border Consistency (Dark Mode)

- **Card Border Styling**: Fixed inconsistent border appearance between device cards and vulnerability cards in dark mode
  - Resolved thick white borders on device cards that didn't match the thin dark borders on vulnerability cards
  - Updated `.device-card, .vuln-card` CSS rule in `vulnerabilities.html` to use theme-aware CSS variables
  - Changed hard-coded values to CSS variables for proper theme adaptation:
    - `background: white` → `background: var(--tblr-bg-surface)`
    - `border: 1px solid #e2e8f0` → `border: 1px solid var(--tblr-border-color)`
  - Both card types now display consistent borders across light and dark themes
  - **Engineering Insight**: Hard-coded CSS values prevented proper theme adaptation despite external stylesheet rules
  - **Resolution Method**: Systematic investigation using sequential thinking and disciplined Memento documentation

#### AG-Grid Table Container Overflow (Spec 004)

- Fixed AG-Grid table overflow causing excessive white space in Vulnerability Data Workspace
- Removed problematic grid-height-manager.js calculations and vulnerability-table-fix.css
- Implemented clean flexbox solution for natural container sizing:
  - `.card-body.p-2` uses `display: flex` with consistent minimum height
  - `.view-content` with `flex-grow: 1` for proper space distribution
  - `#vulnGrid` with `height: 100%; flex-grow: 1` for natural expansion
- Table now properly expands for 10, 25, 50, 200 items without overflow or excessive padding
- **Engineering Insight**: Simple CSS flexbox approach solved what complex JavaScript calculations could not
- **Lesson Learned**: Elegant solutions often emerge from removing complexity rather than adding it
