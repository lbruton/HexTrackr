#### HEX-87: HTTPS Support with Self-Signed Certificates

**Feature**: Development environment HTTPS implementation using self-signed certificates

**Purpose**: Critical security foundation for upcoming authentication implementation (HEX-80/81)

**Technical Implementation**:

- Generated 10-year self-signed SSL certificate for localhost development
- Enhanced Express server to support both HTTP and HTTPS modes via environment configuration
- Added dotenv configuration loading to server.js for environment variable support
- Implemented protocol-aware server creation maintaining Socket.io compatibility
- Updated Docker configuration to support HTTPS container deployment
- Enhanced health checks to work with both HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Added certificate directory structure with proper .gitignore exclusions

**Environment Configuration**:

- `USE_HTTPS=true` enables HTTPS mode
- `SSL_KEY_PATH` and `SSL_CERT_PATH` for certificate locations
- Maintains backward compatibility with HTTP mode for testing

**Files Modified**:

- `app/public/server.js` - Added HTTPS server creation and dotenv support
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added HTTPS port mapping and certificate volume mounts
- `Dockerfile` - Updated health check to support both protocols
- `.env` - Added HTTPS configuration variables
- `.gitignore` - Added certificate exclusions
- `certs/` - New directory with self-signed certificate files

**Security Impact**:

- Enables secure cookie testing for authentication
- Provides foundation for session-based authentication
- Prepares development environment for production-like HTTPS workflows
- Browser certificate warnings expected and acceptable for development

**Browser Access**:

- HTTP: `http://localhost:8080` (development) / `http://localhost:8989` (Docker)
- HTTPS: `https://localhost:8080` (development) / `https://localhost:8989` (Docker)
