### Added - Import Summary HTML Export

#### Professional Report Generation

  - **Self-Contained Files**: Reports include all necessary CSS (Tabler.io framework, HexTrackr variables, component styles) embedded inline
  - **Professional Formatting**: Complete document structure with metadata headers, generation timestamps, and HexTrackr branding
  - **Print-Friendly Styling**: Optimized CSS for both screen viewing and professional printing

#### Technical Implementation (4)

- **CSS Extraction Engine**: Automated system fetches and combines 7 key stylesheets into single embedded block
  - Tabler.io framework, CSS custom properties, modal styles, badges, cards, tables, and base styles
  - Font Awesome icons via CDN import for universal compatibility
  - Custom print media queries for professional output
- **Dynamic File Naming**: Descriptive filenames using pattern `HexTrackr_Import_Report_YYYY-MM-DD_[source-filename].html`
- **Blob Download Pattern**: Follows established file export approach with proper MIME types and browser compatibility

#### User Experience Enhancements

- **Visual Feedback System**: Export button provides clear state indicators
  - Loading state with spinner and "Generating..." text
  - Success confirmation with checkmark and "Downloaded!" message
  - Error handling with warning icon and failure notification
- **Conditional Visibility**: Export option only appears when import summaries contain meaningful CVE discovery data
- **Non-Disruptive Integration**: Feature seamlessly extends existing import workflow without affecting standard operations

### Fixed - Import Modal State Persistence

#### Clean Loading States

- **Resolved Stale Data Display**: Fixed issue where previous import summaries appeared during new import loading phases
  - **Root Cause**: `resetProgressState()` function didn't clear `importSummary` data or associated DOM elements
  - **Solution**: Added explicit `importSummary: null` reset and summary container cleanup
- **Complete State Reset**: Enhanced modal initialization to properly clear all previous session data
  - Hide and clear `progressSummary` container content during reset
  - Reset export button visibility to prevent stale UI states
  - Ensure clean slate for each new import operation

#### Technical Improvements

- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Improved progress modal data handling to prevent state leakage between sessions
- **DOM Cleanup**: Systematic clearing of dynamically created summary content and UI elements
- **ESLint Compliance**: All code modifications passed linting validation with zero errors
