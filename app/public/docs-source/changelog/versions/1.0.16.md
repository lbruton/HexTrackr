## [1.0.16] - 2025-09-18

### Fixed (14)

#### Documentation Navigation State Management

- **Navigation State Persistence Issue**: Fixed dual highlighting of menu sections when navigating to documentation from external pages
  - Root cause: Saved navigation state from localStorage was restored even when accessing docs from tickets/vulnerabilities pages
  - Solution: Detect external navigation via `document.referrer` and clear saved state for clean entry
  - Added exclusive menu expansion to prevent multiple sections appearing active simultaneously
  - Overview page now always starts with all menus collapsed for consistent presentation

#### Version Consistency

- **Health API Version Mismatch**: Fixed health endpoint reporting outdated version (1.0.13 instead of 1.0.15)
  - Root cause: Hardcoded `HEXTRACKR_VERSION=1.0.13` in docker-compose.yml overriding code defaults
  - Solution: Enhanced docs generation script to automatically sync version across all files

### Changed (4)

#### Version Management System

- **Centralized Version Updates**: Enhanced html-content-updater.js with comprehensive version synchronization
  - Single source of truth: `app/public/package.json`
  - Automatically updates: footer.html, docker-compose.yml, root package.json, and server.js fallback
  - Runs during `npm run docs:generate` to maintain version consistency project-wide
  - Prevents version drift across multiple hardcoded locations
