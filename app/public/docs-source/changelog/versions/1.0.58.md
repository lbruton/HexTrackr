### Fixed

#### KEV Modal Light Mode Readability (HEX-172)

**Overview**: Fixed KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerability) modal header readability in light theme by adding appropriate contrast and warning colors while preserving dark mode's existing perfect styling.

**Problem**:
- Light mode KEV modal header had white background with white text - completely unreadable
- Close button (X) was too light to see clearly
- Dark mode was working perfectly with red header and white text

**User Feedback**:
- "cannot read the header, its white, along with the text"
- "lets make the text black, and the header a light red"
- "the X in the corner to close the window is too light, lets make it black"

**Solution Implemented**:

**Light Mode Only Changes**:
- **Header Background**: Light red gradient (#fecaca → #fca5a5) for urgency signaling
- **Header Text**: Pure black (#000000) for maximum readability
- **Close Button**: Black (using CSS filter: brightness(0))
- **Border**: Red accent (#dc2626) for critical alert context

**Dark Mode**: Completely untouched - red header with white text remains perfect

**Technical Details**:

```css
/* Light mode only - make header readable with warning color */
[data-bs-theme="light"] #kevDetailsModal .modal-header {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fecaca 0%, #fca5a5 100%) !important;
    color: #000000 !important;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #dc2626 !important;
}

/* Make close button black for readability */
[data-bs-theme="light"] #kevDetailsModal .modal-header .btn-close {
    filter: brightness(0);
}
```

**Design Philosophy**:
- Light mode uses soft red tones with high-contrast black text for professional appearance
- Dark mode retains bold red header for dramatic urgency signaling
- Critical nature communicated through header color without overwhelming the interface
- Fire emoji 🔥 and alert banner provide additional urgency context

**Result**:
- Fully readable KEV modal in both light and dark themes
- Professional, accessible design with WCAG AA contrast compliance
- Theme-appropriate urgency signaling (subtle in light, bold in dark)
- Preserved existing dark mode styling that was already working
