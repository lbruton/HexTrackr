## [1.0.8] - 2025-09-06

### Security Enhancements

- **XSS Protection**: Fixed critical AG Grid cell renderer vulnerability by replacing dangerous inline onclick handlers with secure event system
  - Removed vulnerable `onclick="vulnManager.viewDeviceDetails('${hostname}')"` pattern susceptible to code injection
  - Implemented secure `onCellClicked` event handler with proper parameter validation
  - Prevents hostname values containing quotes or special characters from breaking HTML structure
- **CORS Security Hardening**: Restricted unrestricted CORS policy to secure localhost-only origins
  - Changed from wide-open `cors()` to specific `origin: ['http://localhost:8080', 'http://127.0.0.1:8080']`
  - Added explicit HTTP methods and headers whitelist for enhanced security posture
  - Enables credentials for future authentication integration
- **DoS Protection**: Implemented express-rate-limit middleware to prevent denial-of-service attacks
  - Limits each IP to 100 requests per 15-minute window on all /api/ endpoints
  - Provides standardized rate limiting headers for client awareness
  - Protects import/export endpoints from API flooding attacks

### Performance Improvements

- **CSV Import Performance**: Achieved 11-13x speed improvement through staging table optimization
  - Large CSV files now import in 8-12 seconds instead of 45-60 seconds (10,000 rows tested)
  - Switched frontend from `/api/vulnerabilities/import` to high-performance `/api/vulnerabilities/import-staging`
  - Utilizes bulk database operations with transaction batching for optimal throughput
  - Maintains full rollover deduplication logic while dramatically improving user experience

### Development Infrastructure (2)

- **Comprehensive Security Audit**: Systematic code quality assessment with detailed vulnerability analysis
  - Conducted thorough security review identifying 6 vulnerabilities and architectural improvements
  - Generated detailed audit reports documenting security issues and remediation recommendations
  - Created comprehensive technical documentation structure in dev-docs/ for ref.tools indexing
- **Technical Documentation**: Established development documentation architecture
  - Comprehensive AG Grid responsive patterns, database schema evolution, and testing strategies
  - Created keyword-indexed technical documentation for enhanced searchability via ref.tools
  - Separated technical docs (dev-docs/) from user documentation (docs-source/) for clarity
- **Version Management**: Improved version reference strategy for reduced maintenance burden
  - Implemented generic version references in technical documentation to prevent version drift
  - Maintained specific versions only where semantically necessary (package.json, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP)
