### Fixed (16)

#### Vulnerability VPR Aggregation (Totals & Trends)

- Fixed inflated per‑severity VPR totals caused by multi‑CVE split rows each carrying the full VPR score
  - Root Cause: Daily totals used `SUM(vpr_score)` over `vulnerabilities_current`, multiplying VPR when a single plugin row listed multiple CVEs
  - Solution: Enhanced daily totals now aggregate VPR by a deduplicated key and sum once per vulnerability entity per host
    - Aggregation key preference: `plugin_id + host` → fallback `plugin_name + host` → fallback `host + description`
    - Counts remain row-based (each CVE row counts); only VPR totals are deduplicated
  - Impact: Stat cards and trend chart now align; Medium spike resolved without altering per‑row VPR in tables
  - Files: `app/public/server.js` (calculateAndStoreDailyTotalsEnhanced)

#### Trend Badge Wiring and Casing

- Fixed trend badges (+/−%) stuck at 0% due to trends not being wired and key casing mismatch
  - Wire: Orchestrator now sets trends on `VulnerabilityStatisticsManager` before UI update
  - Casing: Use capitalized severity keys from `/recent-trends` and robust fallback to data manager trends
  - Files: `app/public/scripts/shared/vulnerability-core.js`, `app/public/scripts/shared/vulnerability-statistics.js`

#### Dark Mode Accessibility Critical Fixes (WCAG Compliance)

- **Navigation Contrast Violation Resolution**: Fixed critical WCAG AA compliance issue
  - **Root Cause**: Selected navigation items had white text on white background (1:1 contrast ratio)
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper dark mode color hierarchy using HexTrackr surface variables
    - Active states: `#2a3f54` background with `#e2e8f0` text (high contrast)
    - Hover states: `#1e293b` background with consistent readable text
    - Sub-navigation: `#94a3b8` muted text with `#243447` hover background
  - **Impact**: Ensures accessibility compliance for visually impaired users
  - **Validation**: Tested across documentation portal, tickets, and vulnerabilities pages

#### Documentation Portal Specific Fixes

- **Header Spacing Issue Resolution**: Eliminated unwanted space above documentation portal header
  - **Root Cause**: CSS rule `.navbar { margin-top: 1rem; }` in docs-tabler.css pushing header down
  - **Solution**: Commented out problematic CSS rule (lines 13-17 in docs-tabler.css)
  - **Impact**: Documentation portal header now aligns consistently with tickets/vulnerabilities pages
  - **Method**: Systematic investigation using sequential thinking and user feedback
- **Breadcrumb and Layout Improvements**: Enhanced documentation page structure
  - Fixed breadcrumb spacing to prevent cramped appearance above menu items
  - Resolved page header positioning conflicts
  - Enhanced documentation content area scroll behavior
  - Improved loading spinner visibility and positioning

  - Improved modal contrast and text readability
  - Fixed table styling in both light and dark modes with proper variable usage
  - Enhanced blockquote styling with theme-aware background colors
  - Resolved loading spinner visibility issues in modal contexts
