## [1.0.27] - 2025-09-24

### Added - KEV Badge on Device Cards

#### Enhanced Risk Visibility

- **Consistent UI Indicators**: Added KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) badges to device cards, creating visual consistency with vulnerability cards
  - **Badge Appearance**: Red KEV badge displays in upper right corner when ANY vulnerability on that device is in CISA's KEV catalog
  - **Risk Assessment**: Users can now instantly identify high-risk devices requiring immediate attention
  - **Click Functionality**: Clicking KEV badge opens device details modal to view all vulnerabilities affecting that device

#### Technical Implementation (2)

- **Backend Enhancement**: Extended device aggregation logic to track KEV status across all vulnerabilities per device
  - Modified `getFilteredDevices()` in `vulnerability-data.js` to include `hasKev` property
  - Added KEV tracking during vulnerability iteration: `if (vuln.isKev === "Yes") { device.hasKev = true; }`
- **Frontend Integration**: Enhanced device card generation to display KEV badges
  - Updated `generateDeviceCardsHTML()` in `vulnerability-cards.js` with KEV badge HTML
  - Used identical badge structure as vulnerability cards for UI consistency
- **Styling Consistency**: Extended existing KEV CSS styles to support device cards
  - Added `.device-card .kev-indicator` selectors to match vulnerability card styling
  - Maintained responsive design and accessibility features

#### User Experience Improvements

- **Immediate Risk Recognition**: Security teams can quickly scan device cards to identify compromised systems
- **Operational Efficiency**: Faster prioritization of remediation efforts based on visual KEV indicators
- **UI Consistency**: Uniform KEV badge appearance across all card types (vulnerability cards and device cards)
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support with ARIA labels and focus indicators

#### Files Modified (3)

- `app/public/scripts/shared/vulnerability-data.js`: Device aggregation logic for KEV tracking
- `app/public/scripts/shared/vulnerability-cards.js`: Device card HTML generation with KEV badges
- `app/public/styles/pages/vulnerabilities.css`: Extended KEV indicator styles for device cards

#### Linear Issue

- **HEX-10**: v1.0.27: Feature - Add KEV Badge to Device Cards (Completed)
