## [1.0.55] - 2025-10-09

### Added

#### Production SSL Certificate Implementation (HEX-176, HEXP-17)

**Overview**: Replaced self-signed SSL certificates with professional Sectigo-issued Multi-Domain certificate across both development and production environments, eliminating browser security warnings and establishing trusted HTTPS connections.

**Certificate Details**:
- **Provider**: Namecheap PositiveSSL Multi-Domain Certificate
- **Issuer**: Sectigo Limited (Sectigo Public Server Authentication CA DV R36)
- **Coverage**: 3 domains via Subject Alternative Names (SAN)
  - hextrackr.com (primary domain)
  - www.hextrackr.com (www subdomain)
  - dev.hextrackr.com (development environment)
- **Validation Method**: DNS CNAME validation (compatible with private IP infrastructure)
- **Validity Period**: October 9, 2025 → November 9, 2026 (13 months)
- **Cost**: $20/year (vs $8/year × 3 domains = $24 for individual certificates)

**Implementation Architecture**:
- Multi-Domain (SAN) certificate enables dev/prod parity with single certificate file set
- Same cert.pem/key.pem/bundle.pem files deployed to both environments:
  - Production: Ubuntu server at 192.168.1.80 (private IP, airgapped)
  - Development: Mac M4 Docker container at 127.0.0.1
- nginx reverse proxy terminates SSL at port 443, forwards to Node.js on port 8080
- Version-independent: SSL operates at nginx layer, decoupled from application version

**User Experience Improvements**:
- ✅ No more "Your connection is not private" browser warnings
- ✅ No more typing "thisisunsafe" to bypass self-signed certificate alerts
- ✅ Professional appearance with valid certificate chain trusted by all browsers
- ✅ PositiveSSL trust seal badge displayed in footer
- ✅ Consistent SSL configuration between dev and prod environments

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Simplified Certificate Management**: Single certificate renewal annually (vs 3 separate renewals)
- **Deployment Parity**: Identical SSL configuration across all environments
- **Airgapped Compatibility**: DNS CNAME validation works with private IPs where HTTP-01 challenge fails
- **Version Independence**: Production can run v1.0.49 (pre-auth) while dev runs v1.0.54+ without SSL conflicts
- **Security**: CA-signed certificate with proper chain of trust to Sectigo root CA

**Files Modified**:
- `certs/cert.pem`: Public certificate from Sectigo (644 permissions)
- `certs/key.pem`: Private key (600 permissions for security)
- `certs/bundle.pem`: Intermediate certificate chain (644 permissions)
- `app/public/scripts/shared/footer.html`: Replaced "Coded with Vibes" badge with PositiveSSL trust seal

**Validation**:
- ✅ Certificate verified on production (hextrackr.com) - Sectigo issuer confirmed
- ✅ Certificate verified on development (dev.hextrackr.com) - Sectigo issuer confirmed
- ✅ All 3 SANs present in certificate (hextrackr.com, www, dev)
- ✅ nginx containers restarted and serving new certificates
- ✅ Browser warnings eliminated on both environments
- ✅ Footer badge displays PositiveSSL trust seal

**Issues**:
- [HEX-176](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEX-176) - SSL Certificate Implementation (Research/Planning)
- [HEXP-17](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/HEXP-17) - SSL Certificate Installation (Production Deployment)

### Changed

#### Footer Badge Update

**Change**: Replaced "Coded with Vibes" Reddit community badge with PositiveSSL certificate trust seal in shared footer component.

**Rationale**:
- Displays professional security credential to users
- Reinforces trust and credibility with valid SSL certificate
- Links to PositiveSSL certificate information
- Maintains consistent badge styling with other footer elements

**Badge Details**:
- **Image**: Official PositiveSSL trust seal (124x32px)
- **Link**: https://www.positivessl.com (certificate provider information)
- **Title**: "Secured with PositiveSSL Multi-Domain Certificate"
- **Styling**: 20px height, responsive with img-fluid class

**Files Modified**:
- `app/public/scripts/shared/footer.html`: Badge replacement (line 42-44)

**Visual Impact**: Footer now displays security-focused trust seal alongside technology stack badges (SQLite, Express.js, Tabler UI).
