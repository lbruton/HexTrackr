## [1.0.22] - 2025-09-21

### Enhanced - KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) Integration

#### AG-Grid Table Improvements

- **Filterable KEV Column**: Replaced fire emoji (🔥) with filterable YES/NO pills in KEV column
  - Red badge for "YES" (vulnerability is in KEV catalog)
  - Blue badge for "NO" (not in KEV catalog)
  - Follows same design pattern as severity and VPR columns for consistency
  - Enables proper filtering using AG-Grid's built-in text-based filter system

- **KEV Column Filtering Fix**: Fixed KEV column filtering to work with AG-Grid's filtering system
  - Changed database query to return 'Yes'/'No' text values instead of 1/0 boolean
  - Updated column renderer to parse text values for proper filtering compatibility
  - Made KEV badges clickable to open detailed KEV modal for vulnerability information

#### KEV Modal Enhancements

- **CVE Details Integration**: Added "View CVE Details" button in KEV modal
  - Opens vulnerability details modal for comprehensive CVE information
  - Provides seamless navigation between KEV catalog info and full vulnerability details
  - Uses existing `showVulnerabilityDetailsByCVE()` function for consistency

- **NIST NVD Integration**: Replaced CISA KEV Catalog link with NIST NVD link
  - Uses pattern `https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/${cveId}` for direct CVE lookup
  - Provides more comprehensive vulnerability information from authoritative source
  - Both modal buttons now use consistent primary button style for better UI cohesion

- **Clickable Links in Notes**: Made all HTTPS links in KEV additional notes clickable
  - Links open in 1200x1200px popup windows for consistency with rest of application
  - Automatic regex replacement converts plain URLs to clickable links
  - Preserves existing text while enhancing usability

#### Filter Dropdown Improvements

- **Filter Option Cleanup**: Removed fire emoji from KEV filter option in severity dropdown
  - Changed dropdown option from "🔥 KEV" to simply "KEV" for cleaner interface
  - Maintains clear identification of KEV filtering without emoji clutter

- **KEV Filter Logic Fix**: Fixed KEV filter to properly match vulnerabilities
  - Added special handling in filter logic to distinguish KEV from severity filtering
  - Fixed filter matching to properly check `isKev === "Yes"` when KEV filter selected
  - Ensures consistent filtering behavior across grid, cards, and modal contexts

### Fixed - KEV Data Handling

- **Database Service Updates**: Updated vulnerability service to return text-based KEV values
  - Changed database query from returning 1/0 to 'Yes'/'No' text values
  - Ensures compatibility with AG-Grid's text-based filtering system
  - Maintains data integrity while improving UI functionality

- **Component Consistency**: Fixed KEV handling across all vulnerability components
  - Updated vulnerability cards to check for text value "Yes" instead of boolean
  - Ensured consistent KEV data interpretation in grid, cards, modals, and filters
  - Eliminated discrepancies between different UI components
