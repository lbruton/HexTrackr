#### HEX-100: Resolved CVEs Tracking in Import Summaries

**Feature**: Import summaries now show **both** new CVEs discovered AND CVEs resolved/removed between scans, providing complete vulnerability lifecycle visibility.

**Problem**: Previous versions only tracked NEW CVEs, making it impossible to see remediation progress or validate patching efforts.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Backend: New SQL query identifies CVEs present in previous snapshots but missing from current scan
- Frontend: Green "✅ Resolved CVEs" section showing resolved count, affected hosts, VPR reduction, and last seen date
- Reports: Included in both modal display and downloadable HTML exports

**Benefits for Security Teams**:

- Track remediation progress: "3 CVEs resolved this week"
- Validate patching efforts: "CVE-2024-12345 patched across 50 hosts"
- Complete picture: Risk increases (new) + Risk reductions (resolved) = Net impact

**Files Modified**:

- `app/services/importService.js` - Added resolved CVE query and summary data
- `app/public/scripts/shared/progress-modal.js` - Added resolved CVEs UI section
