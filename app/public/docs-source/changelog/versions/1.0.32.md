### Fixed (8)

#### HEX-65: Dark Mode White Flash Elimination

**Issue**: White flash occurring when navigating between pages in dark mode, particularly noticeable in Firefox

**Resolution**: Implemented multi-layered theme application system to eliminate flash of unstyled content (FOUC)

**Technical Implementation**:

- Added inline theme detection script in HTML `<head>` that executes before CSS loads
- Implemented fallback chain: localStorage → sessionStorage → OS preference → light theme
- Added critical dark theme styles to `base.css` for immediate card theming
- Commented out unnecessary loading toast that caused additional flash
- Enhanced toast manager to detect and apply current theme to containers
- Updated component initialization to detect pre-applied themes

**Files Modified**:

- `app/public/vulnerabilities.html` - Added inline theme detection script
- `app/public/tickets2.html` - Added inline theme detection script
- `app/public/styles/shared/base.css` - Added critical dark theme card styles (lines 82-95)
- `app/public/scripts/shared/vulnerability-core.js` - Disabled loading toast on page load (line 296)
- `app/public/scripts/shared/toast-manager.js` - Added theme detection for toast containers

**Performance Impact**:

- Zero white flash during navigation
- No additional latency
- Smooth transitions between pages
- Maintains architectural principles (modular CSS structure)

**Browser Compatibility**:

- Tested in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge
- Supports private browsing mode via sessionStorage fallback
- Handles legacy storage formats (both JSON and plain string)
