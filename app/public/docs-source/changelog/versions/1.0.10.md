## [1.0.10] - 2025-09-07

### Fixed - Real-Time Progress Tracking

- **WebSocket Progress Updates**: Fixed CSV import progress modal hanging at 95% with spinning loading circle
  - **Session ID Synchronization**: Resolved frontend/backend session ID mismatch preventing real-time updates
    - Frontend generating: `import_1757226509515_1rd7p4qpd`
    - Backend generating: `cb92e1d6-42fa-4e8b-a01f-4ca6533011d3`
    - Fixed by modifying server.js to use frontend's sessionId instead of UUID generation
  - **Progress Complete Event Handling**: Added missing `progress-complete` event listener in WebSocket client
    - Server was emitting `progress-complete` but frontend only listened for `progress-update`
    - Added proper completion handler in `websocket-client.js` and `progress-modal.js`
    - Fixed JavaScript error: `this.updateProgressBar is not a function` → changed to `this.updateUI()`
  - **Page Refresh Integration**: Fixed modal closing without refreshing underlying data
    - Added `window.refreshPageData` function to `vulnerability-manager.js`
    - Progress modal now properly triggers data refresh after successful import completion
    - Eliminates blank page state on first upload after modal close

### Enhanced - User Experience Improvements

- **Progress Modal Cleanup**: Hidden hardcoded Current/Total/ETA display elements
  - Added `d-none` class to progress details section showing "0 0 --" placeholder values
  - Server already tracks current/total/eta internally for future enhancement implementation
  - Clean modal interface focusing on percentage progress and success messaging

### Performance - Import Processing Validation

- **CSV Import Speed**: Confirmed excellent import performance at ~6.8 seconds for 10,000 rows
  - User-reported "hanging at 95%" was UI issue, not performance problem
  - Bulk SQLite operations with transaction batching maintaining optimal throughput
  - WebSocket progress updates now properly display real-time progress from 5% → 95% → completion
