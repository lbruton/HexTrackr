## [1.0.26] - 2025-09-23

### Fixed - Low Severity Vulnerability Visibility

#### Critical Bug Resolution

- **Complete Visibility Restored**: Fixed critical issue where 3,314 Low severity vulnerabilities were completely hidden from users
  - **Root Cause**: VPR-based sorting combined with 10K frontend limit pushed Low severity items (VPR 1.4-5.1) beyond visible range
  - **Impact**: Users could not filter, view, or access any Low severity vulnerabilities despite their presence in database
  - **Severity**: Critical - affected core vulnerability management functionality

#### Backend Sorting Optimization

- **Severity-Balanced Algorithm**: Implemented intelligent sorting to ensure all severity levels remain visible

  ```sql
  ORDER BY isKev DESC,
           CASE severity
             WHEN 'Critical' THEN 1
             WHEN 'High' THEN 2
             WHEN 'Medium' THEN 3
             WHEN 'Low' THEN 4
           END ASC,
           vpr_score DESC,
           last_seen DESC
  ```

  - **KEV Priority Maintained**: Known Exploited Vulnerabilities still appear first
  - **VPR Sorting Preserved**: Within each severity level, VPR scores determine order
  - **Distribution Guarantee**: All severity levels now appear in first 10K-30K results

#### Frontend Performance Optimization

- **Async Processing Implementation**: Resolved UI freezing when loading large vulnerability datasets
  - **Chunked Processing**: 24,660 vulnerabilities processed in 1000-item chunks using `requestIdleCallback()`
  - **Non-Blocking UI**: Browser remains responsive during data processing
  - **Progress Feedback**: Real-time loading indicators ("Processing vulnerabilities... 5000/24660")
  - **Fallback Support**: `setTimeout()` fallback for browsers without `requestIdleCallback()`

- **Data Capacity Increase**: Frontend limit increased from 10K to 30K to accommodate all vulnerabilities
  - **Complete Dataset**: All 24,660 current vulnerabilities now loaded for comprehensive filtering
  - **Compressed Transfer**: GZIP compression maintains efficient 614KB payload (vs 21MB uncompressed)
  - **Completeness Monitoring**: Added automatic warnings when approaching 90% of data limits

#### Technical Performance Metrics

- **Network Efficiency**: 614KB compressed transfer with 97% compression ratio
- **Processing Speed**: 1000 items per chunk with idle callback scheduling
- **UI Responsiveness**: Sub-2-second load times maintained with progress feedback
- **Memory Management**: Incremental processing prevents browser memory spikes
- **Data Integrity**: All 3,314 Low severity items now accessible through filtering

#### User Experience Improvements (2)

- **Filtering Functionality**: Low severity filter now returns all 3,314 items (previously 0)
- **Complete Visibility**: Users can access full vulnerability dataset across all severity levels
- **Loading Feedback**: Progressive loading messages prevent perceived application freezing
- **Responsive Interface**: UI remains interactive during background data processing

### Technical Implementation (3)

- **Files Modified**:
  - `vulnerabilityService.js`: Backend sorting algorithm
  - `vulnerability-data.js`: Async processing with chunking and progress events
- **Commits**: `e0538ec` (backend sorting), `2faa0cb` (async processing)
- **Performance Strategy**: Balanced approach maintaining filtering capability while optimizing browser performance
