# Subagents Analysis Directory

This directory stores analysis reports generated by HexTrackr subagents with Gemini cross-validation.

## Directory Structure

```
/subagents/
├── reviews/           # Code review reports
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD/   # Daily organization
├── debugging/         # Debug analysis reports
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD/   # Daily organization
└── temp/             # Temporary analysis files (cleared regularly)
```

## Workflow

1. **Initial Analysis**: Subagent performs initial review/debug
2. **Save Initial**: Results saved as `[timestamp]-initial.md`
3. **Gemini Validation**: Gemini reviews the initial analysis
4. **Save Validation**: Gemini results saved as `[timestamp]-gemini.md`
5. **Combine**: Both reports merged into `[timestamp]-final.md`
6. **Return**: Path to final report returned to user

## File Naming Convention

```
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-[type]-[stage].md
```
