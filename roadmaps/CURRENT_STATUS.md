# HexTrackr Current Sprint Status

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD009 -->

Last updated: August 27, 2025

## 🎯 **CURRENT FOCUS: Code Quality & Security Compliance**

**Working From**: Codacy security scan results and compliance initiative  
**Current Task**: Security fixes for v1.0.3 release blocking issues  
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Release blocker - 4 security vulnerabilities identified)  
**Progress**: ESLint config completed ✅, Security fixes pending  

## ✅ **COMPLETED TODAY: AI Documentation Generation System**

**Achievement**: Successfully implemented comprehensive documentation generation  
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅  
**Results**:

## 2025-08-28

- Pre-work backup committed and pushed to origin/copilot.
- Docs portal: Implemented dynamic overview stats via `/api/docs/stats` and front-end refresh in `docs-prototype/js/docs-tabler.js`. Static numbers remain as fallback if the API is unreachable.

## Tomorrow's Priority: Documentation System Rebuild

**Issue Identified**: Gemini generator created new files instead of updating existing 1:1 structure  
**Root Cause**: Generator designed to create new docs, not enhance existing docs-source files  
**Required Fix**: Rebuild generator to UPDATE existing docs-source/*.md and maintain exact file mapping  
**Files Affected**: All documentation portal pages (docs-system.html, etc.)  
**Goal**: Maintain 1:1 relationship between docs-source/ and docs-prototype/content/  

**Original Plan**: Replace documentation portal header with shared header from main app  
**Updated Plan**: First fix documentation generation, then integrate shared header

## 🟡 **PARALLEL FOCUS: Ticket Modal Enhancements**

**Working From**: `/roadmaps/TICKET_MODAL_ENHANCEMENTS_20250827.md`  
**Current Task**: Task 7 - Add Reverse Sort Toggle  
**Priority**: HIGH (User workflow optimization and production functionality)
