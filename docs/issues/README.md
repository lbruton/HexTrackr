# Issues Folder - Temporary Work Tracking

**Purpose**: Track work items when Linear workspace is unavailable

**Status**: Temporary solution until Linear workspace limit resolved

---

## Organization

Each issue group gets a subfolder:
- `oct2025-team-feedback/` - Team presentation feedback (UI refinements, mitigation feature)
- (add more as needed)

## File Naming Convention

Within each subfolder:
- `00_TRACKING.md` - Overall tracking document (summary of all work items)
- `01_WORK_ITEM_NAME.md` - Individual work item specifications
- `02_WORK_ITEM_NAME.md` - Next work item
- etc.

## When Linear is Available

1. Create Linear issues from work item files
2. Link Linear issue IDs in markdown files (e.g., "Linear: HEX-XXX")
3. Archive completed work to `/docs/archive/issues/`
4. Keep folder as backup reference

## Relationship to SRPI Docs

**This folder** (`/docs/issues/`):
- Actionable work items (ready to implement)
- Testing checklists
- Implementation tracking
- Quick reference for "what needs to be done"

**SRPI folder** (`/docs/srpi/`):
- Deep research and analysis
- Architecture investigations
- Planning artifacts
- Long-term reference for "why we built it this way"
